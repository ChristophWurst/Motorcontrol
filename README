Motorcontrol linux device driver by Christoph Wurst

This Linux device driver creates PWM signals on parallel port. To measure motor speed interrupts on the ACK-pin are used.

There is a conflict with "parport_pc" driver. To use Motorcontrol parport_pc needs to be on the module blacklist so it isnt loaded on startup. Otherwise parport_pc disables the parallel port at release, so you cannot use it again with this driver.

To create device file use:
mknod /dev/motorcontrol c 48 0

To check wheter the driver successfully registered the I/O port use:
cat /proc/ioports
There you should see "motorcontrol" on 0x378

To check if the IRQ was registered successfully use:
cat /proc/interrupts
You should see "motorcontrol" at IRQ 7 (default).
